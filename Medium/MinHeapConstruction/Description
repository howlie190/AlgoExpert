Implement a MinHeap class that supports:
Building a Min Heap from an input array of integers.
Inserting integers in the heap.
Removing the heap's minimum / root value.
Peeking at the heap's minimum / root value.
Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting and removing values.
Note that the heap should be represented in the form of an array.
If you're unfamiliar with Min Heaps, we recommend watching the Conceptual Overview section of this
question's video explanation before starting to code.
