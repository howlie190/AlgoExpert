You're given two Linked Lists of potentially unequal length. These Linked Lists potentially merge at a
shared intersection node. Write a function that returns the intersection node or returns None / null if
there is no intersection.
Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in
the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.
Note: Your function should return an existing node. It should not modify either Linked List, and it should
not create any new Linked Lists.
